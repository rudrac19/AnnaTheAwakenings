<h1>AnnaTheAwakenings</h1>

<p>
<strong>Anna Part 1: The Awakenings</strong> marks the beginning of a psychological horror trilogy that explores fear, memory, and guilt. 
You awaken in a desolate environment, unsure of how you got there; only one name echoes in your mind: <em>Anna</em>. 
As you explore the eerie surroundings, fragments of reality begin to fracture. 
Objects move when you’re not looking. Voices whisper in rooms you thought were empty. 
The line between dream and nightmare slowly fades as you uncover cryptic notes, twisted puzzles, and the truth buried deep within Anna’s past. 
Each step forward draws you closer to a horrifying revelation — one that will change your understanding of everything you’ve seen. 
The story is not about survival alone, but about facing what lies beneath the surface of the mind. 
With atmospheric sound design, unsettling visuals, and an ever-present sense of dread, 
Anna Part 1 delivers an unforgettable experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark.
